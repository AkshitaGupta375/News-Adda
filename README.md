# News-Adda
A React News API application is a web application that fetches and displays news articles from external news services using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Built with React.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating dynamic user interfaces, this type of application provides users with up-to-date news in a seamless and interactive manner.

The application integrates a third-party News API such as NewsAPI.org, Google News API, or other public APIs, allowing it to retrieve real-time news from various sources based on categories like technology, sports, business, health, and more.
